I am a Computer Graphics and Machine Learning enthusiast and I am passionate about everything these two areas yield once intertwined, including Computer Vision and Multiple View Geometry. I also like to delve within the mathematical models behind these fields in order to deeply understand the process of inferring knowledge from data.

I graduated the <a href="http://fmi.unibuc.ro/">University of Bucharest, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science</a> with the bachelor thesis "3D Reconstruction with automatic background filtering" graded with 9.66 (out of 10) whereupon I tackle a popular problem in Computer Vision and contribute with significant improvements time- and robustness-wise. During my time as an undergraduate student, I've also partaken in the development of software projects ranging from Video Games to Full-Stack Web Applications.

In addition to my academic acomplishments, I enjoy working in teams and have a great sense of teamwork, leadership and responsibility and communication skill, as I held preparatory Algorithm and Data Structures and Object Oriented Programming courses to freshmen in my university as part of a tutoring programme and, furthermore, I developed Android applications in a teamwork-driven environment as part of a summer internship.
