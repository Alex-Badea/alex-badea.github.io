# DogEspace
A social networking platform for your four-legged barky friend that features breed recognition provided by Amazon Web Services for every photo you upload and was made with Microsoft's asp.net technology.

This project was made for the "Software Engineering" course by a team of 4 students. My contributions to this project were, besides some bug fixes and slight refactorings, security features that allow each type of user (unlogged, unconfirmed, user and admin) to access only what they're permitted to. I've also created the ViewDog and ViewUserDogs pages.
